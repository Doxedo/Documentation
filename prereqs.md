# Prerequisites

## Install tools

The LDoc command-line tools are part of `lt` (LinkORB Tool) which you will need to install. 
Please refer to the installation guide of `lt` for further details

## Select and install your favorite text editor

You can use any simple text editor to author content and maps. 
However, syntax highlighting for `md` (topic content) and `xml` (maps) will 
make things easier.

On Linux `gedit` can be used for this, or you can install Eclipse.
